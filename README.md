## About

- There is no authentication in the app. When user opens the app for the first time, a guest user is created in the DB.

- Main routes of the app are as follows:

  - [Users](https://github.com/blueberry404/DrawAndGuess-BE/blob/main/src/users/users.route.ts)
  - [Room](https://github.com/blueberry404/DrawAndGuess-BE/blob/main/src/room/room.route.ts)

- Words are seeded into DB when server is started.
- Web Sockets have been used for communication between different users. 
- The user who creates the room is Admin as well as master, that broadcasts to other users about timely events such as timer start, next turn, navigation etc.

You can check sockets event management [here](https://github.com/blueberry404/DrawAndGuess-BE/blob/main/src/socket/index.ts).
